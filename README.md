i also do

ever wondered about my conventions? (probably not):
- my comments are mostly lowercase
- My README.md or Documentations are professional (very)
- usually i do comments like
```cpp
/*
  comment
*/
// comment
```

a quote goes like:
"When you know assembly, all software becomes opensource!"
